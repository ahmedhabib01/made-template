# `Parking Violation in Bonn, Germany`

This code repository contains exercises and a project developed during the course **Methods of Advanced Data Engineering** in winter semester 2023/24 of the MSc. Data Science at FAU Erlangen. 
Within it is the published automated data pipeline which downloads the data from a specified URL, transform data, and connects with database to load the data in it using different programming tools such as python/javyee.


## Background of project

Parking violation pose a widespread challenge in urban regions, leading to disruptions for both inhabitants and tourists. Pinpointing zones with heightened instances of parking violations empowers stakeholders to efficiently direct their attention and resources toward resolving the issue. Knowledge about regions or streets exhibiting the greatest frequency of infractions aids urban planners in refining parking infrastructure, enables law enforcement agencies to strengthen enforcement tactics, and empowers parking management companies to deploy focused solutions. Embracing this data-centric methodology supports informed decision-making and the judicious allocation of resources.

## Description of project
This project focuses on analyzing parking violation data in Bonn to identify and visualize hotspots in areas or streets with frequent violations. The integration of datasets, Parking Violation Data and street directory data provides valuable insights for urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and parking management companies. By strategically addressing these hotspots, people of different areas of interest can optimize parking infrastructure, enhance enforcement strategies, and implement targeted solutions for more efficient parking solutions.


## Datasets

For this project two datasets have been used being downloaded from different URLs.

Following datasets have been used.

[1]: The dataset on parking violations in Bonn includes details such as date, time, location, and violation type, offering a comprehensive record of offenses. This dataset serves as a vital source for pinpointing hotspots and analyzing patterns in parking violations.

[2]: The street directory dataset for Bonn provides comprehensive details about streets, roads, and intersections, encompassing names, locations, and characteristics. When merged with parking violation data, this integration facilitates the pinpointing of streets or areas with a high frequency of parking violations.
